  - title: Connect the DB
    desc: >
      We can get a connection for the Intendo MySQL database with either of two
      functions: `db_con()` or `db_con_p()`. Make sure you have credentials info
      available as environment variables.
    contents:
    - db_con
    - db_con_p

  - title: Access to DB tables
    desc: >
      There are three tables in the database, and, three functions that work
      to get us a `tbl_dbi` object from each.
    contents:
    - tbl_functions

  - title: Getting KPIs
    desc: >
      We can get KPIs with specialized functions for each. This makes it easy
      to get reporting information quickly. The KPIs currently supported are:
      `get_dau()`, `get_mau()`, `get_dac()`, and `get_arpu()`. With the
      `segment_daily_users()` function, we can create segmented versions of
      DAU.
    contents:
    - get_dau
    - get_mau
    - get_dac
    - get_arpu
    - segment_daily_users

  - title: Standardized Reporting
    desc: >
      With the `create_standard_ts_plot()` and `create_stanard_kpi_table()`
      functions, we have a means to generate a standardized ggplot and gt table.
      This is useful for reporting purposes and, for that reason, an R Markdown
      template is provided with these functions in a data processing chunk.
    contents:
    - create_standard_ts_plot
    - create_stanard_kpi_table
