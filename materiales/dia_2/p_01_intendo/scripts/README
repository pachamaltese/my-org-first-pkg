Here are some ideas for initial data access functions for the package. I tested
them out on my local machine and they seemed to work fine.

The functions are:

db_con() -- for connecting to the intendo database (using environment variables)
db_con_p()  -- also like db_con() except that it forces use to use a password

tbl_daily_users() --|
tbl_revenue() ------|
tbl_users() --------`-- these use the DB connection to get us the DB tables
